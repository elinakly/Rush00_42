# Rush00

Rush00 is a group project at School 42 designed to test your teamwork, problem-solving skills, and ability to write clean, functional code under time constraints. The project involves creating a program that generates ASCII art representations of rectangles, demonstrating understanding of loops, conditionals, and teamwork.

## Project Details
- **Score**: 116/100
- **Language**: C
- **Teamwork**: This project is completed in collaboration with other students.

## Features
- Generates ASCII art representations of rectangles based on user input.
- Handles various sizes and edge cases.
- Demonstrates clean code structure and adherence to 42’s coding standards.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rush00_42
   ```
3. Navigate to the ex00:
   ```bash
   cd ex00
   ```  
## Usage
To compile the project, use:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c main.c rush00.c -o rush00
```

Run the program with the desired width and height:
```bash
./rush00 <width> <height>
```
For example:
```bash
./rush00 5 3
```
This will generate a 5x3 rectangle in ASCII art.

## Advice for Success
- **Divide and Conquer**: Split tasks among team members to work efficiently.
- **Clear Communication**: Regularly discuss progress and challenges with your teammates.
- **Test Frequently**: Ensure your program works with various input sizes and edge cases.
- **Time Management**: Allocate time wisely and don’t procrastinate.
- **Adhere to Norms**: Follow 42’s coding standards to avoid penalties during evaluation.

## Good Luck!
Rush00 is a fun and collaborative way to learn coding under pressure. Embrace the challenge, support your teammates, and enjoy the experience. Best of luck with your project!
